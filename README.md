so here in in Check Serviceability i want a extra feature so we need to add one extra column in the Pin_Code_Area collection so all the pincode should be marked No serviceable and if we make it serviceable from the pin code management system keep a checkbox if clicked then its serviceable and rest stay unserviceable

update the pincode management for both office and admin
